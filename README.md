# Advent of Code 2017 in F#

## How do I run it?

`dotnet run <questionnumber>`, e.g. to solve question 4, `dotnet run 4`

## Why?

Advent of Code is a great opportunity to pick up a new language but Christmas is the time of year when I have the least amount of time to do so. So in preparation for Christmas 2020 I'm planning on slowly working through the challenges from a previous year and hopefully learn a bit of F# as I do so!

## Why 2017, why not the latest?

Because 2017 is the only year I stuck with it and completed Advent of Code. [I did it in Python](https://gist.github.com/mattmarch/7fcec1b1dffdc63f4d053e24a8e06227) and thought it'd be fun to compare solutions as I go through.
